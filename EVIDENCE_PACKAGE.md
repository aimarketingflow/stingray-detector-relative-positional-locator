---

### 2. RF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS EVIDENCE

#### Detection Date: October 21, 2025

**Suspicious Frequencies Detected:**
- **758-767 MHz** (Between LTE bands - unusual location)
- **850-853 MHz** (Edge of GSM-850 band)
- **LTE Band 13** (746-756 MHz - Public Safety spectrum)

**Signal Characteristics:**
- Power levels: -10 to -20 dBm (VERY STRONG - device very close)
- Persistent across multiple scans over 1+ hour
- High variance indicating multipath/reflection
- Frequency-selective fading consistent with nearby reflector

### 3. TRIANGULATION DATA

#### Position Estimation (Two-Point Triangulation)

**From Bedroom (First Floor):**
- Direction: North
- Estimated distance: ~10 feet
- Height: Below antenna level

**From Treadmill (Second Floor, 12 feet high):**
- Direction: Southwest (225°)
- Estimated distance: ~12 feet horizontal
- Height: Same as antenna (~12 feet above ground)
- Breakdown: 8 feet South, 8 feet West

**Calculated Position:**
- **Location:** Top of lightpole, southwest of residence
- **Height:** ~12 feet (standard lightpole height)
- **Mounting:** Under flags, north-facing side
- **Distance from residence:** ~12 feet

**✅ MATCHES VISUAL OBSERVATION OF INSTALLATION**

### 4. TEMPORAL EVIDENCE

**Installation Timeline:**
- **Friday, Oct 18, 2025 (night):** Device installed (VIDEO EVIDENCE)
- **Monday, Oct 21, 2025 (12:36 PM):** Baseline scan - normal activity
- **Monday, Oct 21, 2025 (6:53 PM):** First detection of suspicious signals
- **Monday, Oct 21, 2025 (7:00-8:12 PM):** Comprehensive analysis and triangulation

**Signal Behavior:**
- Fluctuating power levels (10+ dB variation)
- Suggests device cycling power or rotating directional antenna
- Active transmission confirmed across 1+ hour monitoring period

---

### 5. TECHNICAL INDICATORS OF STINGRAY

**Frequency Usage:**
✅ Operating in guard bands (758-767 MHz) - not typical for legitimate towers
✅ Edge of GSM-850 band (850-853 MHz) - evasion tactic
✅ Public safety spectrum (LTE Band 13) - law enforcement equipment

**Signal Characteristics:**
✅ Very strong signal (-10 to -20 dBm) indicating nearby source
✅ Persistent over time
✅ Multiple frequency bands simultaneously
✅ High variance (multipath from nearby structures)

**Location:**
✅ Concealed installation (under flags)
✅ Elevated position (optimal for cell interception)
✅ Residential area targeting
