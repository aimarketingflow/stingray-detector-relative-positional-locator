üéØ Introducing: Open-Source Stingray Detection & Location System

I've just released a complete toolkit for detecting and locating unauthorized cellular surveillance devices (IMSI catchers/Stingrays) using Software Defined Radio and RF echo location.

üî¨ What it does:
‚Ä¢ Detects suspicious RF signals in cellular bands
‚Ä¢ Uses directional scanning to pinpoint device location
‚Ä¢ Triangulates exact 3D position using FSPL mathematics
‚Ä¢ Tracks movement patterns (mobile vs. stationary)
‚Ä¢ Analyzes multipath reflections for accuracy
‚Ä¢ Automated monitoring & scheduling

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features:
‚Ä¢ PyQt6 GUI with visual directional guides
‚Ä¢ Command-line tools for power users
‚Ä¢ Photo annotation with measurement overlays
‚Ä¢ Community reporting via GitHub
‚Ä¢ "Stingray Go" - gamified tracking system
‚Ä¢ 100% legal receive-only monitoring

üí° The Science:
Inspired by echolocation (bats/dolphins), we passively analyze RF signals to map surveillance devices. By measuring signal strength from multiple directions and locations, we can calculate distance, bearing, and height using Free Space Path Loss formulas.

üåç Why This Matters:
Stingrays aren't just used by law enforcement - hackers and criminals can deploy them near homes, businesses, and public spaces. This toolkit empowers individuals to detect threats and protect their privacy.

üéì Educational Value:
‚Ä¢ RF engineering & signal processing
‚Ä¢ Python/PyQt6 development
‚Ä¢ Scientific methodology
‚Ä¢ Privacy rights & civil liberties

üì¶ Tech Stack:
HackRF One ($300), Python, PyQt6, GNU Radio, PIL/Pillow

### Version 2: Story-Driven

```
üö® I caught someone installing a surveillance device on a lightpole outside my house.

Here's how I used $300 of hardware and open-source software to detect, locate, and document it...

Last Friday night, I witnessed suspicious individuals installing equipment on a lightpole in my neighborhood. Instead of just wondering, I decided to investigate using RF spectrum analysis.

üî¨ The Setup:
‚Ä¢ HackRF One (Software Defined Radio)
‚Ä¢ Custom Python detection software
‚Ä¢ RF echo location methodology

üìä The Process:
1. Established baseline of normal cellular activity
2. Detected anomalous signals at 760-766 MHz (between LTE bands)
3. Ran directional scans from multiple locations
4. Triangulated exact position: 12 feet high, southwest direction
5. Tracked over time to confirm stationary installation

üéØ The Results:
Signal strength: -10 to -15 dBm (extremely close)
Location: Top of lightpole, concealed under flags
Type: Fixed installation, likely IMSI catcher

üí° The Solution:
I've open-sourced the entire toolkit so anyone can protect themselves:
‚Ä¢ Visual GUI with step-by-step guides
‚Ä¢ Automated monitoring & scheduling
‚Ä¢ Photo annotation tools
‚Ä¢ Community reporting database

üåç Building a Movement:
This isn't just about one device - it's about empowering communities to detect surveillance threats. The toolkit includes a "Stingray Go" feature where users can track and share findings globally.

üìö The Science:
Using RF echo location (inspired by bats), we passively analyze cellular signals to map surveillance devices. It's 100% legal (receive-only) and incredibly effective.

üéì 15 years of AI/algorithm theory + musician/songwriter + techie coder = the ultimate privacy protection toolkit.

### Version 3: Call-to-Action

```
üõ°Ô∏è Your phone is being tracked. Here's how to fight back.

Stingrays (IMSI catchers) aren't just in spy movies - they're deployed by hackers, criminals, and unauthorized actors in neighborhoods, businesses, and public spaces RIGHT NOW.

I just released a complete open-source toolkit to detect and locate them.

‚úÖ What You Get:
‚Ä¢ Beautiful GUI with visual guides
‚Ä¢ Directional scanning & triangulation
‚Ä¢ Automated 24/7 monitoring
‚Ä¢ Photo annotation tools
‚Ä¢ Global community database
‚Ä¢ "Stingray Go" - track them like Pokemon

üî¨ The Tech:
‚Ä¢ HackRF One SDR ($300)
‚Ä¢ RF echo location algorithms
‚Ä¢ FSPL-based triangulation
‚Ä¢ Multipath analysis
‚Ä¢ Movement tracking

üì∏ Real Results:
I detected a device on a lightpole outside my house, triangulated its exact position (12ft high, southwest), and documented everything. Video evidence included.

üåç Join the Movement:
1,000+ people detecting surveillance = global protection network

Your contribution helps protect others.
