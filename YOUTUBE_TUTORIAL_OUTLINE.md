# YouTube Tutorial: "I Found a Stingray Spying on My Neighborhood - Here's How to Detect One"

## Video Outline

### INTRO (1-2 min)
- **Hook:** "I caught people installing a surveillance device on a lightpole outside my house. Here's the video." [Show clip]
- **What is a Stingray?** IMSI catcher, cell site simulator, fake cell tower
- **Why this matters:** Privacy, civil liberties, often used without warrants
- **What we'll cover:** How I detected it, how YOU can detect one too

### PART 1: The Discovery (3-4 min)
- **Friday night:** Saw suspicious individuals installing device on lightpole
- **Recorded video** of installation (show footage)
- **Device location:** Under flags, concealed, ~12 feet high
- **Initial suspicion:** Why would random people be installing equipment at night?

### PART 2: The Investigation (5-7 min)
- **Equipment used:**
  - HackRF One ($300 SDR - Software Defined Radio)
  - Laptop with free software
  - Basic antenna
  - **Total cost: ~$300-400**
  
- **What we're looking for:**
  - Unusual frequencies (758-767 MHz, 850-853 MHz)
  - Very strong signals from nearby source
  - Signals that don't match normal cell towers
  
- **The process:**
  1. Baseline scan (normal RF environment)
  2. Detection scan (found suspicious signals)
  3. Directional scanning (pinpointed location)
  4. Triangulation (confirmed exact position)

### PART 3: The Evidence (5-7 min)
- **Show the data:**
  - Spectrum analyzer visualization
  - Signal strength graphs
  - Directional scan results
  - Triangulation showing exact location
  
- **Key findings:**
  - Signals at -10 to -20 dBm (VERY strong = very close)
  - Operating in unusual frequency bands
  - Location matches visual observation
  - Active for multiple days
  
- **Multipath analysis:** Building reflection confirmed
- **Movement tracking:** Signal fluctuates but stays in same location

### PART 4: How YOU Can Do This (8-10 min)

#### Equipment Needed:
- **HackRF One** (~$300) - or RTL-SDR (~$30 for basic detection)
- **Laptop** (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- **Antenna** (comes with HackRF)

#### Software Setup:
- **macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  brew install hackrf
  ```
- **Windows:** Zadig drivers + hackrf tools

#### Step-by-Step Detection:

**Step 1: Baseline Scan**
```bash
hackrf_sweep -f 700:960 -f 1710:1990 -N 100 -r baseline.csv
```

**Step 2: Look for Suspicious Signals**
- 758-767 MHz (between LTE bands)
- 850-853 MHz (edge of GSM-850)
- 746-756 MHz (public safety band)
- Very strong signals (-10 to -30 dBm)

**Step 3: Directional Scanning**
- Point antenna in different directions
- Find strongest direction
- Narrows down location

**Step 4: Triangulation**
- Scan from 2+ locations
- Compare directions and signal strengths
- Calculate position

#### I'll provide:
- **GitHub repo** with all scripts (free, open source)
- **Detailed tutorial** in video description
- **Analysis tools** (Python scripts)

### PART 5: What This Means (3-4 min)
- **Legal implications:**
  - Stingrays often used without warrants
  - Violates 4th Amendment (unreasonable search)
  - Affects EVERYONE in the area, not just targets
  
- **Who uses them:**
  - Law enforcement (FBI, DEA, local police)
  - Private investigators
  - Foreign intelligence
  - Criminals
  
- **Your rights:**
  - Receive-only monitoring is 100% LEGAL
  - You have the right to know if you're being surveilled
  - You can document and report this

### PART 6: What I'm Doing (2-3 min)
- **Continued monitoring:** Daily scans to document activity
- **Legal action:** Contacting ACLU, EFF, privacy advocates
- **Public awareness:** This video!
- **Evidence preservation:** All data backed up and timestamped

### PART 7: What YOU Should Do (2-3 min)
- **Check your neighborhood:** Use these tools
- **Document everything:** Photos, videos, RF scans
- **Report it:**
  - ACLU: aclu.org
  - EFF: eff.org
  - FCC: consumercomplaints.fcc.gov
  
- **Protect yourself:**
  - Use encrypted messaging (Signal)
  - Airplane mode when not using phone
  - VPN for internet
  - Be aware of surveillance

### OUTRO (1-2 min)
- **Call to action:**
  - Subscribe for updates on this case
  - Download the detection tools (link in description)
  - Share this video - people need to know
  
- **Final thoughts:**
  - Privacy is a right, not a privilege
  - Technology can be used for good (detection) or bad (surveillance)
  - We have the power to fight back with knowledge

## Video Description Template

**Title:** "I Caught Them Installing a Stingray on My Street (Here's How to Detect One)"

**Description:**
```
I witnessed suspicious individuals installing a device on a lightpole outside my house. Using a $300 Software Defined Radio (HackRF One), I confirmed it's an active cellular surveillance device (Stingray/IMSI catcher).

In this video, I show you:
‚úÖ Video footage of the installation
‚úÖ RF spectrum analysis proving it's transmitting
‚úÖ Triangulation pinpointing exact location
‚úÖ How YOU can detect Stingrays in your area

üõ†Ô∏è DETECTION TOOLS (FREE):
GitHub: [Your repo link]
- All scripts and analysis tools
- Step-by-step tutorial
- Frequency reference guide

üì° EQUIPMENT USED:
- HackRF One: https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/
- Alternative (budget): RTL-SDR (~$30)

## Key Talking Points for Video

### Why This Matters:
- "Stingrays don't just target one person - they intercept EVERYONE's phone in the area"
- "Often used without warrants - violates 4th Amendment"
- "You have a RIGHT to know if you're being surveilled"

### Making It Accessible:
- "You don't need to be a hacker or engineer"
- "Basic equipment costs less than a new phone"
- "All software is free and open source"
- "I'll walk you through every step"

### Empowerment:
- "Knowledge is power - they rely on people NOT knowing this exists"
- "We can use the same technology to detect them"
- "This is legal, ethical, and necessary for privacy rights"

### Call to Action:
- "Check YOUR neighborhood - you might be surprised"
- "Share this video - spread awareness"
- "Document and report - create a paper trail"
- "Together we can push back against warrantless surveillance"

## B-Roll Footage Ideas

- HackRF One close-up
- Antenna pointing in different directions
- Laptop showing spectrum analyzer
- Graphs and data visualizations
- Lightpole exterior shots (from public property)
- Maps showing triangulation
- Screenshots of analysis output
- News articles about Stingray abuse
- ACLU/EFF websites

---

## Safety Considerations for Video

### DO:
‚úÖ Show the detection process
‚úÖ Explain the technology
‚úÖ Provide educational resources
‚úÖ Encourage legal reporting
‚úÖ Emphasize receive-only monitoring is legal

### DON'T:
‚ùå Show your exact address
‚ùå Encourage illegal activity (jamming, hacking)
‚ùå Make unsubstantiated claims about who installed it
‚ùå Show faces of installers (potential legal issues)
‚ùå Encourage confrontation or vigilante action

### Legal Protection:
- "Allegedly" when discussing who might have installed it
- "Suspected Stingray" rather than definitive claims
- Focus on facts: "This device is transmitting on these frequencies"
- Emphasize educational purpose
